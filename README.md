## Happy Birthday!!!

### Wish someone special to you, a happy birthday in a special way.

It was a birthday of one of my friends and I wanted to wish her a happy birthday in a special way, so I put together this animated web-page in a jiffy so I could say Happy Birthday; In a special way.

Feel free to use it to wish your friends, family and loved ones if you want.
You can get it running in a few easy steps:

* Fork the repository
* Open `customize.json` file and replace name/wish-message/image with your custom name/wish-message/image.
* Turn on GitHub pages for the repository (Settings > GitHub Pages) and view the deployment.
* Send the URL that you get at the above step to your friend; after ensuring it displays right.

I've created the JSON file for easy and quick customizability. If you want to do more customizing, simply edit the HTML file. But in that case, leave the JSON fields empty since it overwrites the HTML. Please note that I've created this page in a hurry and it comes with no warranty, so check yourself before sending it to your friend.

I've used plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for animations.
